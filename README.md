# Blinkenlights-Basic-Irony-Interpreter
A Blinkenlights BASIC interpreter written in C# using the Irony parser.

This implementation of the "Blinkenlights BASIC" interpreter utilizes the .NET IronyProject .NET language implementation kit.  It is based on the implementation based on Antlr that can be found at <https://github.com/pg94au/Blinkenlights-Basic-Antlr-.NET-Interpreter>.  The two projects share the same interpreter and test suite, almost unchanged.
